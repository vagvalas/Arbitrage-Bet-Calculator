# Arbitrage-Bet-Calculator

A simple arb-betting calculator, for finding minimum position profit, or budget needed
As soon as I realized what arbitrage betting is I wanted to try it οθτ and somehow I had to quickly calculate the odds and the amount to bet.
It has a check whether the odds are (opposite) so it can then calculate the info needed.
All the math types are solved by me, in hand, and then trascripted into python.

#USES
Maybe (its illegal in some countries and bookers) but you can make some profit.
USE IT at your OWN risk.

#Thoughts

It will be awesome, if in the future can also be scrapping live for odds and getting add, to point out where to bet and where not.
